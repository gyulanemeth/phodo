			<h2>People usually forget about things.</h2>
			<p>That is the reason why we usually write <i>to-do lists</i>. Our brains just don't work like computers. We need reminders to accomplish everything we want.</p>
			<p>Imagine a situation when you know you should call your mother, since it has been a very long time since you last spoke. Mothers have a way of making us feel very ashamed when we don't call them.</p>

			<h2>Our world is in hurry</h2>

			<p>Most people don't really time to spare. The lack of time causes us to forget about things even more. The unfortunate situation is that sometimes people don't even have time to make to-do lists.</p>
			<p>Creating a picture is usually more than enough. Pictures can remind you things which are very difficult to express verbally.</p>

			<p>Putting a picture of your mother in a to-do list will do much more to remind you to call her than a note that says "Call Mom".</p>

			<h2>A picture is worth 1000 words</h2>

			<p>Phodo allows you to create visual to-do lists, using pictures you take, or pictures sourced from the cloud.</p>

			<p>Visual reminders provide better mental association than text-based to-do lists. Studies suggest that our brains can recognize an image in as little as <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2542583/Scientists-record-fastest-time-human-image-takes-just-13-milliseconds.html">13 milliseconds</a>. Compare that with the time it takes to read text-based items on a list, and there's no question which is more efficient.
